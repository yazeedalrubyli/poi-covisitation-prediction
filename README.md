## 📋 Abstract

Understanding where people go after visiting one business is crucial for urban planning, retail analytics, and location-based services. However, predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between spatial proximity and business relationships. We introduce **NAICS-aware GraphSAGE**, a novel graph neural network that integrates business taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale co-visitation patterns.

Our key insight is that business semantics—captured through detailed industry codes—provide crucial signals that pure spatial models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end framework.

## 🔥 Key Contributions

1. **Methodological Innovation**: First end-to-end GNN framework that jointly embeds NAICS codes, temporal signals, and spatial relations for population-level co-visitation prediction through edge regression

2. **Strong Performance**: Achieves test R² of 0.625 (157% improvement over best baseline) with significant gains in ranking quality (32% improvement in NDCG@10)

3. **Large-Scale Dataset**: We release **POI-Graph**, comprising:
   - 94.9 million co-visitation records
   - 45.3 million graph edges
   - 92,486 brands across 48 US states
   - 276 NAICS business categories
   - 38 socioeconomic indicators

## 🛠️ Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.12+
- PyTorch Geometric 2.3+
- CUDA 11.3+ (for GPU support)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yazeedalrubyli/poi-covisitation-prediction
cd poi-covisitation-prediction

# Create conda environment
conda create -n poi-covisit python=3.8
conda activate poi-covisit

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download the POI-Graph dataset (12.3 GB)
python scripts/download_data.py --dataset poi-graph
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Training a Model

```python
from naics_graphsage import NAICSGraphSAGE
from data_loader import POIGraphDataset

# Load dataset
dataset = POIGraphDataset(
    root='./data/poi_graph',
    state='TX',  # Texas as example
    lookback_months=12
)

# Initialize model
model = NAICSGraphSAGE(
    input_dim=dataset.num_features,
    hidden_dim=128,
    naics_vocab_size=276,
    naics_embed_dim=64
)

# Train
trainer = Trainer(model, dataset)
trainer.fit(epochs=100, lr=0.001)
```

### Making Predictions

```python
# Load trained model
model = NAICSGraphSAGE.load_pretrained('models/best_model.pt')

# Predict co-visitation between two brands
prediction = model.predict_covisit(
    brand_a='Starbucks',
    brand_b='Chipotle',
    state='CA',
    month='2020-01'
)
print(f"Predicted co-visits: {prediction:.0f}")
```
